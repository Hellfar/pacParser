# pacParser

This is both a test to use github to enter the community and sharing this tiny program I made to resolve pac file (I couldn't find a good reliable one on internet).

It miss some functions at the moment and not sure good specificity of the others.

I used Jint to parse the JS, hoping there is not any License probleme here.
